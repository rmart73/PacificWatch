/* Mutation check for the DOM suite. Opt-in like test:dom, since it needs jsdom.

   Why this exists: review of PR #14 found a regression test that could not fail — both
   fixtures in the section carried the same reading, so the bug it was written to catch
   would have passed. Assertions that cannot fail are not evidence, and nothing in a green
   test run distinguishes them from ones that can.

   This breaks one behaviour at a time in a copy of index.html, runs the real DOM suite
   against the mutant, and requires the intended assertion to fail. Production files are
   never modified: every mutant is written to a temporary directory and deleted after.

   Add a case here whenever you add a behaviour worth trusting. If a mutation is reported
   MISSED, the assertion covering it is decorative and should be tightened. */
